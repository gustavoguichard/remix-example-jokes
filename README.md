- Routes (including the nested variety âœ¨)
- Styling
- Database interactions (via `sqlite` and `prisma`)
- Mutations
- Validation
- Authentication
- Error handling: Both unexpected (the dev made a whoopsies) and expected (the end-user made a whoopsies) errors
- SEO with Meta Tags
- JavaScript...
- Resource Routes

## Development

From your terminal:

```sh
npm install
npx prisma migrate dev
npm run dev
```

This prepares the local dev database and starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then apply any database changes:

```sh
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```
